Hi there!

Bhumit here.

By day, I am a Software Engineer working at IBM Ireland. I have recently completed my Master's degree (MSc Computing Science) at [Imperial College London](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_College_London), with a specialism in Software Engineering. I have huge interest in designing software the right way. After churning through lots of research papers on scalable distributed systems design, my interest is to work on one. Having said that, please feel free to take a look at my [CV](https://github.com/bhumit/bhumit.github.io/raw/master/docs/resume.pdf) or drop me an e-mail at <a rel="contact" href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=012dTfQ02CoZsdPLv6jDOJAw==&amp;c=xdN8E_TkUL4LuQ-kSDRVS5T_gnY45JcK3lWPC5Ksk10=" onclick="window.open('http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k\075012dTfQ02CoZsdPLv6jDOJAw\75\75\46c\75xdN8E_TkUL4LuQ-kSDRVS5T_gnY45JcK3lWPC5Ksk10\075', '', 'toolbar=0,scrollbars=0,location=0,statusbar=0,menubar=0,resizable=0,width=500,height=300'); return false;" title="Reveal this e-mail address">[show email]</a>.
