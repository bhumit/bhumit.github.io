title: Now that my exams are done!

Hello everyone! Exams are done. That means, I, for once have some time to blog about what I have been doing so far. As a software engineer it is a shame to not have a simple blog of your own and just write your thoughts and share them with others.

It’s been a long time since i wanted to build my own blog and there’s nothing simpler than [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
